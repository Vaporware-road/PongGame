# PongGame
This game, which was designed by Python language and PyGame library, was an idea for collecting and practicing skills.

## Opjects
There are two objects in this game that are put into the game with the principles of design pattern and object oriented programming
One of the objects is a paddle and the other is a ball, which are positioned according to the correct coordinates.

## Mathematics
In this program, in order to create the correct relationship between the ball and the paddle and the edges of the program image, we have made mathematical calculations that will make the balls move in the right direction and also with what acceleration they will return when they hit the paddle.
